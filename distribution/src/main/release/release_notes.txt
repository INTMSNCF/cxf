with the specified versions, are installed on your system:

    * Java 8 Development Kit
    * Apache Maven 3.x to build the samples


3.  Integrating CXF Into Your Application

classpath. The file lib/WHICH_JARS should help you decide which 
jars you need.

the samples directory and follow the build instructions in the README.txt file 
included with each sample.
